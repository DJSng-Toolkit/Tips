# DJSng's Tips
### Fun facts and tips for Darkhax's "Tips" mod

DJSng's Tips is a personalized tip resource pack with a bunch of references, built in mind for Darkhax's [Tips](modrinth.com/mod/tips) mod (currently for **1.16.3 - 1.21.1**). It features a mix of tips themed after various DJSng projects, including writing projects and DJSng's Toolkit.

**This resource pack only works if you have Tips for 1.16.3 or later.** A 1.12 version is not planned at this time, as it requires editing the configuration file.

If you need an older version, [check us out on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/djsng-tips)!

# Installation
1. Install a version of [Tips](modrinth.com/mod/tips) for 1.16 or later
2. Download the latest release in [Releases](https://github.com/DJSng-Toolkit/Tips/releases)
3. Extract the contents of the .7z files you downloaded
4. Place the .zip file in your `resourcepacks` folder
5. Active the Resource Pack in-game.
6. If the game says the resource pack is outdated, add it anyway.
7. Profit!

It has to be zipped this way because GitHub doesn't let me write the special characters used by the resource pack name :(  
Minecraft uses a specific character to use color codes in pack descriptions, and GitHub trims them from the filename.
