# DJSng's Tips
### Fun facts and tips for Darkhax's "Tips" mod

DJSng's Tips is a personalized tip resource pack with a bunch of references, built in mind for Darkhax's [Tips](modrinth.com/mod/tips) mod. It features a mix of tips themed after various DJSng projects, including writing projects and DJSng's Toolkit.

# Installation
1. Install a version of [Tips](modrinth.com/mod/tips) for 1.16 or later
2. Download the latest release in [Releases](https://github.com/DJSng-Toolkit/Tips/releases)
3. Extract the contents of the .7z files you downloaded
4. Place the .zip file in your `resourcepacks` folder

It has to be zipped this way because GitHub doesn't let me write the special characters used by the resource pack name :(  
Minecraft uses a specific character to use color codes in pack descriptions, and GitHub trims them from the filename.

# Contribution
Just fork this repo and play around for ideas. Remember to read [Tip's documentation on how to add new entries](https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Tips/wiki/Latest-Documentation)!
